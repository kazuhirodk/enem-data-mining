## About

This project seeks to implement some analyzes on ENEM (Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃ©dio) microdata (2019-2022) using data mining with association rules. This repository is used only for educational and non-commercial purposes.

## Instructions

- Rename the microdata files to `microdata-enem-<year>.csv` (replace `<year>` with correspondent year) and place them in the [microdata](/microdata/) directory 
- Run all the steps in the `general-analysis.ipynb` file to run the main analysis
