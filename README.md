# ENEM Data Mining

## About

This project seeks to implement some analyzes on ENEM (Exame Nacional do Ensino MÃ©dio) microdata (2019-2022) using data mining with association rules. This repository is used only for educational and non-commercial purposes.

## Instructions to run analysis

- First we need to download ENEM microdata from [here](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/microdados/enem).
- Rename the microdata files to `microdata-enem-<year>.csv` (replace `<year>` with correspondent year) and place them in the [microdata](/enem/microdata/) directory
- Run all the steps in the `general-analysis.ipynb` file to run the main analysis
- Additional analysis can be found on `covid-analysis.ipynb`

## Paper
- The paper can be found in [this](/enem/paper/article.pdf) directory (only available in PT-BR)
